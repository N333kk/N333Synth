# W3Synth

Web Synth made by me, using only React.

The synthesizer consists of 3 main modules.

Volume module where we can set the global volume of the synth with an emergency stop button.

Oscillators module where we have access to both oscillators and we can set their waveform, octaves and fine tune them.

ADSR module where we can set the global attack, decay, sustain and release of the synth.

You can try it out with a MIDI controller!

Later versions will also have a working step sequencer and the possibility to extract the sound from the browser.
